## Description Of The Project
This about me project will showcase the skills that I have learned in Webpage Development and Design. The first thing I learned was that the code used to create webpages is called HTML. Before we began working on building/coding a webpage, we had to create a netlify and github account. Netlify is the medium through which the webpage would be published and github is where we stored our code into repositories that makes it easy to access your code and any changes you've made to it anywhere. 
    In essence the about me should be a "virtual business card" website. In the first about me, it started off with simple HTML code bu utilizing <p> tags as well as <ul>, <ol>, <strong> and <em>. Then I learned how to add HTML, images and links. To add HTML to a page, I had to use tags, like mentioned before, which tells the browser what kind of structure the page will have. To add an image, I utilized the img src tag and gave it an alt, which can be optional, so that if someone cannot access that particular image, the alt attribute would provide althernative information.
