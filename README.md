# My About Me

## Lori-Ann Nembhard
This is my second semester at RVCC and my major is Information Systems and Technology.

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/37c353fc-07c5-479a-a0fb-a329b5c4c521/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/aboutme-loria/deploys)

## Description Of The Project
This about me project will showcase the skills that I have learned in Webpage Development and Design. The first thing I learned was that the code used to create webpages is called HTML. Before we began working on building/coding a webpage, we had to create a netlify and github account. Netlify is the medium through which the webpage would be published and github is where we stored our code into repositories that makes it easy to access your code and any changes you've made to it anywhere. 

## Colour Scheme
For the colour scheme, I wanted to use colours that were complimentary. The colours used in this project are *#FFE378*,*#5CFFE6*,*#94530A*. Other colours were added as more of supporting colours.
